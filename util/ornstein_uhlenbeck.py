# We'll use a specific noise process that has some desired properties, called the Ornsteinâ€“Uhlenbeck process. It
# essentially generates random samples from a Gaussian (Normal) distribution, but each sample affects the next one such
# that two consecutive samples are more likely to be closer together than further apart. In this sense, the process is
# Markovian in nature.
